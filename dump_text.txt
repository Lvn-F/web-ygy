                            Solar panels are devices that convert sunlight into electricity using a technology called the photovoltaic effect. 
                            They are made up of many solar cells, usually composed of silicon, that absorb sunlight and release electrons, 
                            generating a flow of electric current. This electricity, in the form of direct current (DC), 
                            is then converted into alternating current (AC) by an inverter for use in homes, businesses, or the power grid.
